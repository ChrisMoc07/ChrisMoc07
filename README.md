# Hey, Iâ€™m Chris ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Computer Engineering student starting at UIUC in Fall 2025. Right now, Iâ€™m focused on getting stronger in backend development, AI, and systems that blend software and hardware.

Iâ€™ve worked on a few web apps and interactive tools, and I like building stuff that actually runs â€” not just code that looks good on paper. Whether itâ€™s a chaotic timer that randomly freezes mid-countdown or a JavaFX game with save/load mechanics, Iâ€™m all about projects that teach me something new.

## Current Skills & Tools

- **Languages:** Java, JavaScript, Python, Swift
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (basic layout and styling)
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, Xcode, Arduino
- **Interest Areas:** AI, backend logic, embedded systems

## What I'm Working On

- **DPI Internship** â€“ working on real-world projects and getting deeper into Swift and app dev  
- **Amazon Internship (2026)** â€“ upcoming opportunity to explore software/hardware at scale  
- **Chaos Timer** â€“ a countdown app with unpredictable behavior just for fun  
- **Capstone Java Game (in progress)** â€“ a dungeon crawler built with JavaFX and OOP

## Goals

- Keep building technical projects that stretch what I know  
- Learn more about backend architecture and AI workflows  
- Make the most of the internships Iâ€™ve got lined up  
- Add work Iâ€™m proud of to this GitHub

Feel free to explore my repos. Most are things I made to learn, some are team collabs, and all of them helped me level up.
